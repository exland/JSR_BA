/**
 * This Reduction Strategy implements a slightly improved version of the initial
 * {@link GreedyHGSReductionStrategy}. It is unclear if Harrold, Gupta and Soffa (2015)
 * described this or the latter algorithm, thus we are keeping both for the moment.
 *
 * The improvement over the original implementation is two-fold:
 * 1. After each TC selection round, the table is updated completely, meaning that all
 *    items in all columns of requirements satisfied by the selected TC are marked.
 *    This removes already satisfied requirements and potential TC candidates for further
 *    iterations that would be pointless to investigate further and might lead to suboptimal
 *    results.
 * 2. When selecting a requirement r_b for which a TC is selected, only TCs that satisfy
 *    at least the same number of requirements as TCs r_B are considered. This comes naturally
 *    as a consequence of 1.), as there cannot be columns with less entries than the one currently
 *    under investigation.
 *
 * Since this algorithm is very closely related to {@link GreedyHGSReductionStrategy},
 * we are extending the class and overriding behaviour in the style of a slightly
 * modified "template method" pattern (namely, not using an abstract class as a
 * base class).
